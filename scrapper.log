He really loved it. The camera is average, although 50 MP but the sensors are not that great as compared to other 50 MP phones.Overall I will give 9/10 to this phone.

Not a good choice for gaming.'}, {'Product': 'Realme', 'Name': 'Anuj Kashyap', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Awesome', 'Comment': 'This phone is really to good ......This phone quality and design such a really attractive üòäüòä.......You take this you feel just like a I phone ......ü§ûI hope this phone is better in this price.....I really suggest my friends and family members to buy this phone üì±üì±......‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è'}, {'Product': 'Realme', 'Name': 'Deepak Kumar', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Simply awesome', 'Comment': 'I really like this phone.
